# Hi, IÂ´m JosÃ© Perdomo ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying a data science degree and I'm striving to excel in this knowledge area where I can be useful.

I have been working on my own on the following projects:

- Gender Detector using Machine Learning: An important subset on Data Science is machine learning (enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed)
  Using M.L. you can detect the class or tags that belongs to a sample, knowing this, I thought  it would be interesting to use it for gender classification by using photos of peopleÂ´s faces.
  
- Macronutrient and KiloCalories Tracker: In my personal life I am interest in having healthy habits with my body, one of them is tracking the calories and macronutrients that enter in my organism. To implement this habit on your routine you have to calculate this values from time to time using formulas with your age, weight, height... So I did this code to recalculate my calories with ease and fast.
